# Vector Coordinates, Adding Vectors, and Multiplying a Vector by a Scalar

## What is a vector?
**Vectors** are basically lists of numbers. They have a magnitude and a direction. Vectors are specific examples of **matrices** in that they either have a single row (1 x n, row vectors) or a single column (m x 1, column vectors).

## Given a matrix of values, what does the corresponding vector look like?
The first number of a matrix representing a vector tells you its x component, the second number its y component, and the third number the z component. These components are always parellel to their respective axis.
* For example, matrix [1, 2]  would be a vector (view it as a right triangle) with the a height (y component) of 2 and a length (x component) of 1.

## Adding Vectors
To add vectors, bring the start of one vector to the tip of another vector. Then, add the two matrices (x and y components). Consider it as a pathway, similar to the numberline (fixed one-axis). 

$$ \vec{v} + \vec{w} $$

## Multiplying vectors by a scalar (scaling a vector)
To multiply a vector by a scalar (a constant number, like 1/2, 4, -9.5), you multiply each component of the matrix (vector) by that scalar. This is called **scaling a vector**.

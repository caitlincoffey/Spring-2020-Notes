## Properties of Matrices

- A + B = B + A (Communative Addition)
- (AB)C = A(BC) (Associative Multiplication)
-  AB =/= BA (not always true) (Communative Multiplication)

## 2-D and 3-D Rotation Properties
- 2-D rotation matrix does commute
- 3-D rotation does not commute unless if in the same class (e.g. just rotating along the x-axis)

## Inverse Matrices

- Rotational matrices (RxRz)^-1 = Rz^-1(Rx^-1)
- (AB)^-1 = B^-1(A^-1) given that A and B are square matrices.

## Determinant

- Is the matrix invertible? If the determinant is not equal to 0 (or imaginary), then yes!

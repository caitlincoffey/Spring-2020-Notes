# Spring 2020 Notes

A place to keep my notes for my classes this semester so that I don't have to email them to myself ahead of time or remember to bring my flashdrive when I'm using Ubuntu. 

Feel free to use them, especially if you're like me and need to take notes on things to remember/understand them.
